# HesApp - Subscription Tracker App

## Introduction
HesApp is a subscription tracker application designed to help users manage their subscriptions efficiently. Users can select their subscribed services and visualize their monthly or annual spending.

This application, developed using **'Jetpack Compose'**, efficiently manages user data, subscriptions, and service information using Firestore.

Additionally, users can customize the app's theme according to their preferences. The application supports two language options: Turkish and English, allowing users to switch between languages seamlessly.

I had done this project with XML Layout in previous months. You can access it here: <br> https://github.com/emirsansar/HesApp---Subscriptions-Tracker
